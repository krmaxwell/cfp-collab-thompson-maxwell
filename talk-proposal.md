The Secrets Professional Python Progammers Don't Want You To Know

# Category

- Best practices and patterns

# Duration

- No Preference

# Description
Beginning Python programmers often copy patterns recipes, and idioms from other languages or rely on older tutorials that might not show some of the newer, hotter features of the language. In this talk, we'll demonstrate examples of things that can make your Python more fun, more readable, and more robust.

# Audience
Newer Python programmers

# Python level

- Novice

# Objectives
1: attendees will leave with new recipes for doing common tasks more easily.
2: attendees will learn how specific idioms work together to become far more effective.
3: attendees will learn how to integrate new tools into their existing workflows.

# Detailed Abstract
Many people use Python as a tool to solve problems and analyze data rather than to produce code for others. We write code to help us do our jobs, not just write code as our job. Pythonistas like this don't often get to learn from code that others have written or exploring modules and features beyond the basic tutorials they might have followed. In this talk given by two data analysts, we will show programmers who are ready to move from a "novice" to an "intermediate" level a number of ideas to improve their capabilities. Some of these are very simple while others are simple explanations of deeper topics. Examples include better use of built-in data structures, new tools to analyze and visualize data, and dealing with data from the web in various forms. Each of these ideas is framed as part of a larger integrating narrative that makes them practical and entertaining.
