> The idea here is to make a talk about getting into security data science for
people that don't have a strong math background.

### Topic synopsis
Everyone knows that security data science is teh hawtness right now. Now more
than ever responsible IT security practitioners are looking for ways to back up
their assertions with science rather than FUD. If you didn't pay attention in
math class, though, you might be intimidated by things like p-values and linear
regression. Well don't be! In this talk we'll use a simulated data set and some
python programming to develop a data product. We will develop a research question,
aggregate and clean the data, visualize it, and share the code to give you a
head start on the path to data-driven decision making.
