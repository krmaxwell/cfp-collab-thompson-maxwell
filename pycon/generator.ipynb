So it's a function that can keep track of its variables from call to call without having to have them passed back in or store them in a global somewhere. I think I have a useful example of using this in the real world."

      "I'm working on a project where I wanted to gather statistics about Portable Executables. I wanted to take a random sample of known-good and known-bad files and compare the samples. It seemed easy enough, I just went to my malware collection, grabbed a random sample and processed them. However, not all of the malware samples are valid. For example, the service that I pulled the malware from doesn't distinguish between PE and any other malicious file. So some of my malware is HTML or javascript. And some PE files are so badly formed that they can't be analyzed. From the known good side, some .exe files are actually cached data that Windows makes on the fly and aren't really PE files. So about a third of my random sample was unusable. How get I get a sample of 1000 files which I know are ready for processing?"
