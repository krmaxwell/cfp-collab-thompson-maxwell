Tazz – is a veteran whose technology interests began with Atari and she was amazed when a word processor had enough memory to hold multiple lines.  She’s been involved with technology since 1997 starting her career in communications, then she completed her degree.  She’s had various IT roles and responsibilities over the years to include military communications, Field Software (Breaker/Fixer) Engineer, System Administrator of Chaos, IA Hoodlum, Compliance Nazi, Information Security Cat Herder, Security Architect and is currently a Senior Security Consultant.  Tazz’s next big interest is completing her doctorate of computer science w/ a crazy idea for her thesis aimed at being able to verify the authenticated individual is the person using the device by mapping personality-related traits to the user’s interaction with the device.  She enjoys her #InfoSecFam and the #InfoSecBradyBunch, learning to play XCOM, horseback riding, weather above 70F, and anything full of laughs and weird people.

Optional comments: Talk is targeted at 45 minutes but we have enough material that we could do a 70 minute talk if necessary. We can also cut things viciously and get down to a 20 minute talk if that fits better somewhere.

Short abstract: Threat Intelligence is Teh Hawtness right now, but for small and medium businesses (which make up 80% of employers) it can be difficult to afford and integrate into operations. There are great tools out there for finding and downloading threat intelligence, but then what? In this talk we will present a tool for simplifying log file analysis (without expensive tools like splunk), integrating threat feeds, and responding to protect your assets.

Long abstract: Threat intelligence is a hot topic and everyone is talking about it but many
small and medium businesses lack the budget to purchase expensive tools to gain intel from
their own infrastructure or integrate open source feeds into their operations. We are
developing a tool to make that easier for places with no budget. This tool will
perform log file analysis to aggregate information and create reports without making
the user learn Kibana or pay for splunk. The tool will report about frequently-seen
events as well as ip addresses, and domains. The tool can also ingest a threat
intelligence feed and report on known-bad indicators which are appearing in the users
log files.
