Tazz – is a veteran whose technology interests began with Atari and she was amazed when a word processor had enough memory to hold multiple lines.  She’s been involved with technology since 1997 starting her career in communications, then she completed her degree.  She’s had various IT roles and responsibilities over the years to include military communications, Field Software (Breaker/Fixer) Engineer, System Administrator of Chaos, IA Hoodlum, Compliance Nazi, Information Security Cat Herder, Security Architect and is currently a Senior Security Consultant.  Tazz’s next big interest is completing her doctorate of computer science w/ a crazy idea for her thesis aimed at being able to verify the authenticated individual is the person using the device by mapping personality-related traits to the user’s interaction with the device.  She enjoys her #InfoSecFam and the #InfoSecBradyBunch, learning to play XCOM, horseback riding, weather above 70F, and anything full of laughs and weird people.

Optional comments: Talk is targeted at 45 minutes but we have enough material that we could do a 70 minute talk if necessary. We can also cut things viciously and get down to a 20 minute talk if that fits better somewhere.
