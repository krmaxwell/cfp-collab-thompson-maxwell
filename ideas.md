- Things I wish I knew sooner
- Be lazy. Tips for easier code
- Tricks for python data manipulation

# Things we might talk about

- collections.Counter
- dict.get
- IPython or beaker notebook
- Probably some data frame tricks
- dealing with Unicode <- ermahgerd!!!
- argparse replacing optparse
- requests instead of urllib2
  - grequests for multiple parallel requests

"you must unlearn what you have learned"

One idea: we should avoid using slides and try to do the whole talk using an 
iPython or Beaker notebook.
